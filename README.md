# Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard
This project focuses on creating an interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard using the data from Global_super_store sales. Through this process, I have uncovered several valuable insights.
To begin, I conducted an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to meet the project requirements. Specifically, I used Power Query to clean and transform the data. Additionally, I utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to establish calculated measures and calculated columns.

The dashboard comprises various visualizations, including cards, charts, and slicers, to effectively communicate the significant findings. These visual elements aid in simplifying the comprehension of the insights derived from the data.

Overall, this interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard serves as a valuable tool for analyzing the Global_super_store sales data and gaining meaningful insights.
